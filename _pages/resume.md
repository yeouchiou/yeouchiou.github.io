Work experience
======

* April 2024 - Present: **Senior Machine Learning Engineer, LinkedIn**
* Nov 2021 - April 2024: **Machine Learning Engineer, LinkedIn**
  * Led 3 teams cross functionally to develop a multi-armed bandit platform for premium upsell and online jobs budget recommendation leading to a revenue increase of ~$36M annually. 
  * Created and modeled a precomputed two-tower neural network to serve as the L1 ranking layer of a job recommendation system which saved 17% latency due to the precomputation with neutral relevance impact.
  * Migrated the first L2 job recommendation model to an internal hosted service allowing for further innovations in large parameter models due to scalability service.
   
* Jan 2021 - Sep 2021: **Machine Learning Scientist II, FICO**
  * Developed a Python package to aid users that did not receive favorable decisions from a machine learning model by mining frequent user characteristics and maximizing a submodular objective function from scratch to provide actionable recourse rules.
  * Mentored and formalized a plan for an intern working on developing a specialized hyperparameter search space for loan origination models.
  * Profiled existing algorithms and redesigned them with cProfile to be parallelized using multiprocessing, dask, and ray achieving 30% speedups in data with over 1 million rows.

* June 2019 - Aug 2019: **Data Science Intern, Deloitte** 
  * Applied machine learning techniques to develop credit card fraud detection methods based on historical transaction data while being robust to evolving fraud strategies.
  * Built pipeline for feature generation using a deep autoencoder embedding in Keras as a one-class way of identifying non-fraudulent transactions beating the baseline tree based model of an AUC by 1% potentially saving $1M in fraud.
  * Visualized a high-dimensional dataset with nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques such as T-SNE using sci-kit learn to find clusters of fraudulent transactions.
