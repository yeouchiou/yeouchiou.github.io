Hey, I'm Yeou[^1] Chiou, a machine learning engineer who went from exploring the cosmos ðŸŒŒ to building ML systems ðŸ¤– that are truly out of this world. ðŸš€ 

Currently I'm an MLE at Youtube working on ML and TPU efficiency.

Previously I was an MLE at LinkedIn on the Talent Marketplace Data Foundations team. I work on various job search and recommendation algorithms, as well as multi-armed bandits for premium signups. Before that, I worked as an ML scientist at FICO working on algorithmic bias/fairness and algorithmic recourse. In this role, I developed models aimed at answering questions like: "What steps could have been taken to avoid loan rejection?"

In another life, I received my PhD in astrophysics researching a novel formation mechanism for globular clusters, which I named "Supersonically Induced Gas Objects (SIGOs)". 

Outside of work, I have a passion for attending EDM shows, playing riichi mahjong, immersing myself in Dance Dance Revolution, and mastering [kendama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendama).
