Hey, I'm Yeou[^1] Chiou, a machine learning engineer who went from exploring the cosmos 🌌 to building ML systems 🤖 that are truly out of this world. 🚀 

I’m currently a Machine Learning Engineer at YouTube, focusing on optimizing ML workloads and TPU efficiency to enhance large-scale video recommendation systems.

Before this, I worked as an MLE at LinkedIn on the Talent Marketplace Data Foundations team, where I contributed to job search and recommendation algorithms, and designed multi-armed bandit solutions to drive premium signups.

Prior to that, I was an ML Scientist at FICO, specializing in algorithmic fairness and recourse. There, I developed models that help answer critical questions such as: “What actionable steps could have been taken to prevent loan rejection?”

In another life, I received my PhD in astrophysics researching a novel formation mechanism for globular clusters, which I named "Supersonically Induced Gas Objects (SIGOs)". 

Outside of work, I have a passion for attending EDM shows, playing riichi mahjong, immersing myself in Dance Dance Revolution, and mastering [kendama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendama).
