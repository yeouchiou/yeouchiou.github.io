Hey, I'm Yeou[^1] Chiou, a machine learning engineer who went from exploring the cosmos ðŸŒŒ to building ML systems ðŸ¤– that are truly out of this world. ðŸš€ 

Currently I'm an MLE at LinkedIn on the Talent Marketplace Data Foundations team. I work on various job search and recommendation algorithms, as well as multi-armed bandits for premium signups.

Previously I worked as an ML scientist at FICO working on algorithmic bias/fairness and algorithmic recourse. In this role, I developed models aimed at answering questions like: "What steps could have been taken to avoid loan rejection?"

In another life, I received my PhD in astrophysics researching a novel formation mechanism for globular clusters, which I named "Supersonically Induced Gas Objects (SIGOs)". 

[^1]: pronounced "yo", like "Yo, what's up?"
